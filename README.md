# The Odin Project
## Stock Picker

This repo contains my implementation of the Stock picker project as described in The Odin Project.

The documentation says to: 

```Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.```
  
and gives this example:
```ruby
  > stock_picker([17,3,6,9,15,8,6,1,10])
  => [1,4]  # for a profit of $15 - $3 == $12
```
